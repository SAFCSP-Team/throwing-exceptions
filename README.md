|Throw keyword|[Exception Concept](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/exception-handling-in-java)|
|Throwing exception in java |[Throwing exception Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAOYeVYtukY)|
||[Different between Throws & Throw](https://rollbar.com/blog/how-to-use-the-throws-keyword-in-java-and-when-to-use-throw/#:~:text=The%20throws%20keyword%20is%20used,be%20thrown%20from%20a%20method.)|

**Problem**

Use the ArithmeticException in the method using throwing concept.

**Implementation**

Create the validate method that takes integer value as a parameter. If the age is less than 18, 
we are **throwing the ArithmeticException** otherwise print a message welcome.


```Java

    public static void main(String args[]){   
        System.out.println(" ");    
  }    
}    
```
