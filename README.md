**Problem**



**Implementation**

Create the validate method that takes integer value as a parameter. If the age is less than 18, 
we are **throwing the ArithmeticException** otherwise print a message welcome to vote.


```Java

    public static void main(String args[]){  
        validate();  
        System.out.println("rest of the code...");    
  }    
}    
```
